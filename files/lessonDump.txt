***** Overview *****
The CMS Software (CMSSW) is a collection of software libraries that the CMS
experiment uses in order to acquire, produce, process and even analyze its
data. The program is written in C++ but its configuration is manipulated using
the Python language.
CMSSW is built around a Framework, an Event_Data_Model (EDM), and Services
needed by the simulation, calibration and alignment, and reconstruction modules
that process event data so that physicists can perform analysis. The primary
goal of the Framework and EDM is to facilitate the development and deployment
of reconstruction and analysis software.
The CMSSW_repository is on Github. You can browse this huge amount of code,
search through it using the CMSSW_Software_Cross_Reference or explore the
documentation here.
     CMSSW is a continuously-evolving project. Historically, there has
     been many releases, which are handled on Github using branches. Be
     aware that in this workshop we will use release CMSSW_5_3_32 (the
     official release for 2011/2012 open data), which can be found in the
     CMSSW_5_3_X branch of the repository. This branch may differ a little
     or a lot compared to the bleeding-edge one in the master branch, so
     make sure you are always referencing to the historical one.
***** Structure and architecture *****
As it was mentioned above, the CMSSW software is used for almost all computing
activities in CMS. From data acquisition to data analysis, using different
pieces of CMSSW is very intuitive. Different modules (or plugins) have
different functionalities. Some, for instance, are in charge of setting up
certain services like the magnetic field configuration (we call this type of
code Setup), while others help you create some object that was not there before
(EDProducers) or analyze final data (EDAnalyzers). You can find details here.
In this workshop, we are only going to look at EDAnalyzers.
As an example of modularity, take a look at the package used for reconstructing
tracks. It has many sub-packages that put in evidence the many bits involved in
making a track from detector sensor information. One of those sub-packages is
the TrackProducer, which is in charge of putting (recording) the track
information in the event. Note the structure of this sub-package:
It has the usual look of a C++ repository. Commonly, you can find a src
directory with the bulk of the C++ programming (*.cc files), an interface
directory with mostly the header files (*.h files) matching the code in the
src, and a python directory, where configuration files, written in Python, are
stored. Some other accesories are in other directories. Of course, this is not
a standard rule, and many times the structure follow a different logic. There
is also a Buildfile, which controls the package dependencies.
All these packages are, in a sense, plugins to the main Framework, which is
also a package by itself.
The event data architecture is modular, just as the framework is. Different
data layers (using different data formats) can be configured, and a given
application can use any layer or layers. The following diagram illustrates this
concept if one thinks about how the information from tracks of charged
particles is organized:
All the information regarding the physics of a collision is stored in the
Event. Computationally, one can think of the Event as an object from which you
can pull all the information you need from the collision.
CMS uses different data formats, which are arranged in tiers. Currently CMS
open data comes only in the AOD format, therefore that is the format we will be
mostly using in this workshop.
     ***** Key Points *****
         * The CMS SoftWare (CMSSW) is the software used by the CMS
           experiment for acquiring, producing, processing and analyzing
           its data.
         * CMSSW is built in a modular fashion around a main Framework.

****** Installation and Execution ******
     ***** Overview *****
     Teaching: 0 min
     Exercises: 20 min
     Questions
         * How do I install CMSSW?
         * How do I compile and execute CMSSW?
     Objectives
         * Review the steps necessary to setup a CMSSW area.
         * Learn how to compile and execute CMSSW jobs.
***** Setting up your CMSSW area *****
If you completed the lessons on virtual_machines or Docker you should already
have a working CMSSW area.
    * If you are using the VM:
          o turn on your virtual machine and go to the right shell according to
            the validation_instructions:
            [Choose this shell]
    * If you are using Docker:
          o Start the container with:
            docker start -i <theNameOfyourContainer>
Make sure you change directories to the CMSSW_5_3_32/src area; for instance, in
Docker:
cd /home/cmsusr/CMSSW_5_3_32/src
Note that we are not really “installing” CMSSW but setting up an environment
for it. CMSSW was already installed. This is why every time you open a new
shell you will have to issue the cmsenv command, which is just a script that
runs to set some environmental variables for your working area:
cmsenv
Now you can check, for instance, where your CMSSW_RELEASE_BASE variable points
to:
echo $CMSSW_RELEASE_BASE
The variable may point to a local CMSSW install if you are using a Docker
container:
/opt/cms/slc6_amd64_gcc472/cms/cmssw/CMSSW_5_3_32
or to a place in the shared cvmfs area if working in a virtual machine:
/cvmfs/cms.cern.ch/slc6_amd64_gcc472/cms/cmssw/CMSSW_5_3_32
***** cmsRun, the CMSSW executable *****
All the packages that comprise the CMSSW release in use have been already
compiled and linked to one single executable, which is called cmsRun. So,
unless you want to create your own plugin (addition) for the software, you
won’t even have to re-compile. You can actually try to execute this command by
itself, but it will give you a configuration error:
cmsRun
cmsRun: No configuration file given.
For usage and an options list, please do 'cmsRun --help'.
So, inevitably, the cmsRun executable needs a configuration file. This
configuration file must be written in Python. Do not worry, we will learn all
about configuration in a next episode of this lesson.
     ***** Run with a configuration *****
     Now try to run, but this time with a configuration file.
          ***** Solution *****
          We could simply repeat what we already did while setting up
          our VM or container: run with the Demo/DemoAnalyzer/
          demoanalyzer_cfg.py python configuration file. However,
          this time we could store the output in a dummy.log file and
          run it in the background. Notice the bash redirector >, the
          redirection of stderr to stdout (2>&1), and the trailing
          run-in-the-background control operator &.
          cmsRun Demo/DemoAnalyzer/demoanalyzer_cfg.py > dummy.log
          2>&1 &
          You can check the development of your job with
          tail -f dummy.log
          When finished, if you dump the content of dummy.log
          cat dummy.log
          you’ll get an output similar to:

***** Compilation *****
We use scram, the release management tool used for CMSSW, to compile (build)
the code:
scram b
Reading cached build data
>> Local Products Rules ..... started
>> Local Products Rules ..... done
>> Building CMSSW version CMSSW_5_3_32 ----

>> Creating project symlinks

>> All python modules compiled
>> Pluging of all type refreshed.
>> Done generating edm plugin poisoned information
gmake[1]: Leaving directory `/home/cmsusr/CMSSW_5_3_32'
Note that scram only goes into the Demo/DemoAnalyzer package that we created
locally to validate our setup in a previous lesson. All the rest of the
packages in the release were already compiled. Since there is nothing new to
compile, it finishes very quickly. In a later episode we will modify this
DemoAnalyzer and will need to compile again.
     Point to be made: if you compile at main src level, all the packages
     in there will compiled. However, if you go inside a specific package
     or sub-package, like our Demo/DemoAnalyzer, only the code in that
     subpackage will be compiled.
     Note: if you are using a soft link to an area that is perhaps mounted
     from the host machine (like in the example from the Docker lesson),
     you must compile at the main src level, i.e., /home/cmsusr/
     CMSSW_5_3_32/src, otherwise the compilation will fail. A small price
     to pay for convenience.
***** Additional goodies *****
Your CMSSW environment comes with other executable scripts/tools that can be
very useful. An example of those is the mkedanlzr script that we use already to
create the DemoAnalyzer package. This script creates skeletons for EDAnalyzers
that can later be modified or expanded. Notice that this package, DemoAnalyzer,
has a similar structure as any of the CMSSW packages we mentioned before.
One can find out about other_scripts like mkedanlzr by typing mked and hitting
the Tab key:
mked + Tab
mkedanlzr  mkedfltr   mkedlpr    mkedprod
In this workshop, however, we will not be using those other ones.
There are also additional scripts, like the Event Data Model(EDM) utilities,
the hltGetConfiguration trigger dumper, or the cmsDriver, which can be very
useful. We will talk a bit about these later in the workshop, but now let’s
check an example.
     ***** Finding the EventSize of a ROOT EDM file *****
     Now, as a simple exercise, use one of the EDM utilities mentioned
     above to find out about the number of events in the ROOT file that is
     in the Demo/DemoAnalyzer/demoanalyzer_cfg.py config file of your
     analyzer package.
          ***** Solution *****
          After checking the documentation above, the following one-
          liner will work.
          edmEventSize -v root://eospublic.cern.ch//eos/opendata/cms/
          Run2012B/DoubleMuParked/AOD/22Jan2013-v1/10000/1EC938EF-
          ABEC-E211-94E0-90E6BA442F24.root |grep Events
          File root://eospublic.cern.ch//eos/opendata/cms/Run2012B/
          DoubleMuParked/AOD/22Jan2013-v1/10000/1EC938EF-ABEC-E211-
          94E0-90E6BA442F24.root Events 12279
          So the ROOT file has 12279 events.
     ***** Key Points *****
         * A CMSSW area is not really installed but set up.
         * cmsRun is the CMSSW executable. There are also utilitarian
           scripts.
         * You can compile CMSSW with scram b
===============================================================================
****** EDAnalyzers ******
     ***** Overview *****
     Teaching: 7 min
     Exercises: 1 min
     Questions
         * What is an EDAnalyzer and what does it contain?
         * What files are relevant in a EDAnalyzer?
     Objectives
         * Learn what an EDAnalyzer is and how it is structured
         * Learn what c++, python and xml files are relevant.
***** Structure *****
First, make sure you start up your VM or container like it was discussed in the
previous episode.
EDAnalyzers are modules that allow read-only access to the Event. They are
useful to produce histograms, reports, statistics, etc. Take a look at the
DemoAnalyzer package that we created while validating our CMSSW working
environment; it is an example of an EDAnalyzer.
Go to your CMSSW_5_3_32/src area and make sure you issue the cmsenv command (if
you are in the same session as the previous episode, there is no need to issue
the command again but it never hurts doing it again):
cd <mybasepath>/CMSSW_5_3_32/src
cmsenv
Let’s explore the DemoAnalyzer package:
ls Demo/DemoAnalyzer/
BuildFile.xml  demoanalyzer_cfg.py  doc  interface  python  src  test
ls Demo/DemoAnalyzer/src
DemoAnalyzer.cc
Note that it has a similar structure as any of the CMSSW packages we mentioned
before. In this sense, our DemoAnalyzer is just one more CMSSW package.
However, the headers and implementation of our simple DemoAnalyzer are coded in
one single file under the src directory. The file was automatically named
DemoAnalyzer.cc
     CMSSW could be very picky about the structure of its packages. Most
     of the time, scripts or other tools expect to have a Package/Sub-
     Package structure, just like our Demo/DemoAnalyzer example.
We also notice we have a python configuration file called demoanalyzer_cfg.py
(unlike its cousins, it is not inside the python directory). This is the
default configurator for the DemoAnalyzer.cc code.
Finally, there is a BuildFile.xml, where we can include any dependencies if
needed.
All EDAnalyzers are created equal; of course, if made with the same mkedanlzr,
they will look identical. The DemoAnalyzer.cc is a skeleton, written in C++,
that contains all the basic ingredients to use CMSSW libraries. So, in order to
perform a physics analysis, and extract information from our CMS open data, we
just need to understand what to add to this code and how to configure it.
     ***** Key Points *****
         * An EDAnalyzer is a an edm class that generates a template for
           any analysis code using CMSSW.
         * There are essentially three important files in an EDAnalyzer
           package, the source code in c++, the python config file and a
           Buildfile for tracking dependencies.
===============================================================================
****** The Source ******
     ***** Overview *****
     Teaching: 10 min
     Exercises: 30 min
     Questions
         * What are the elements of the source of an EDAnalyzer?
         * How do I modify the source to get additional information?
     Objectives
         * Learn the basic structure of the C++ implementation of an
           EDAnalyzer.
         * Learn the basics on how to modify the source in order to
           perform analysis.
***** Playing with the DemoAnalyzer.cc file *****
The DemoAnalyzer.cc file is the main file of our EDAnalyzer. As it was
mentioned, the default structure is always the same. Let’s look at what is
inside using an editor like nano:
nano Demo/DemoAnalyzer/src/DemoAnalyzer.cc
The first thing that you will see is a set of includes:
// system include files
#include <memory>

// user include files
#include "FWCore/Framework/interface/Frameworkfwd.h"
#include "FWCore/Framework/interface/EDAnalyzer.h"

#include "FWCore/Framework/interface/Event.h"
#include "FWCore/Framework/interface/MakerMacros.h"

#include "FWCore/ParameterSet/interface/ParameterSet.h"
These are the most basic Framework classes that are needed to mobilize the
CMSSW machinery. In particular, notice the Event.h class. This class contains
essentially all the accessors that are needed to extract information from the
Event, i.e., from the particle collision. Another important class is the
ParameterSet.h. This one will allow us to extract configuration parameters,
which can be manipulated using the Demo/DemoAnalyzer/demoanalyzer_cfg.py python
file.
Something important to take into account is that you can learn a lot about the
kind of information you have access to by exploring the code in the CMSSW
repository on Github. For instance, you can look at the Event.h header and
check all the available methods. You will notice, for instance, the presence of
the getByLabel accessors; we will be using one these to access physics objects.
     When exploring CMSSW code on Github, remember to choose the
     CMSSW_5_3_X branch.
     ***** Including muon headers *****
     Let’s pretend that we are interested in extracting the energy of all
     the muons in the event. We would need to add the appropriate classes
     for this. After quickly reviewing this_chapter of the CMS Open Data
     Guide (which is still under construction), we conclude that we need
     to add these two header lines to our analyzer:
     //classes to extract Muon information
     #include "DataFormats/MuonReco/interface/Muon.h"
     #include "DataFormats/MuonReco/interface/MuonFwd.h"
     Let’s add them at the end of the header section together with the
     standard vector C++ library:
     #include<vector>
     So our header section becomes:
     // system include files
     #include <memory>

     // user include files
     #include "FWCore/Framework/interface/Frameworkfwd.h"
     #include "FWCore/Framework/interface/EDAnalyzer.h"

     #include "FWCore/Framework/interface/Event.h"
     #include "FWCore/Framework/interface/MakerMacros.h"

     #include "FWCore/ParameterSet/interface/ParameterSet.h"


     //classes to extract Muon information
     #include "DataFormats/MuonReco/interface/Muon.h"
     #include "DataFormats/MuonReco/interface/MuonFwd.h"

     #include<vector>
Next, you will see the class declaration:
//
// class declaration
//

class DemoAnalyzer : public edm::EDAnalyzer {
   public:
      explicit DemoAnalyzer(const edm::ParameterSet&);
      ~DemoAnalyzer();

      static void fillDescriptions(edm::ConfigurationDescriptions&
descriptions);


   private:
      virtual void beginJob() ;
      virtual void analyze(const edm::Event&, const edm::EventSetup&);
      virtual void endJob() ;

      virtual void beginRun(edm::Run const&, edm::EventSetup const&);
      virtual void endRun(edm::Run const&, edm::EventSetup const&);
      virtual void beginLuminosityBlock(edm::LuminosityBlock const&, edm::
EventSetup const&);
      virtual void endLuminosityBlock(edm::LuminosityBlock const&, edm::
EventSetup const&);

      // ----------member data ---------------------------
};
The first thing one notices is that our class inherits from the edm::EDAnalyzer
class. It follows the same structure as any class in C++. The declaration of
the methods reflect the functionality needed for particle physics analysis.
Their implementation are further below in the same file.
     ***** Declaring info containers *****
     Let’s add the declaration of a vector for our energy values:
     std::vector<float> muon_e;
     This section becomes:
     //
     // class declaration
     //

     class DemoAnalyzer : public edm::EDAnalyzer {
        public:
           explicit DemoAnalyzer(const edm::ParameterSet&);
           ~DemoAnalyzer();

           static void fillDescriptions(edm::ConfigurationDescriptions&
     descriptions);


       private:
          virtual void beginJob() ;
          virtual void analyze(const edm::Event&, const edm::EventSetup&);
          virtual void endJob() ;

          virtual void beginRun(edm::Run const&, edm::EventSetup const&);
          virtual void endRun(edm::Run const&, edm::EventSetup const&);
          virtual void beginLuminosityBlock(edm::LuminosityBlock const&,
     edm::EventSetup const&);
          virtual void endLuminosityBlock(edm::LuminosityBlock const&,
     edm::EventSetup const&);

          // ----------member data ---------------------------

          std::vector<float> muon_e; //energy values for muons in the
     event
     };
Next, we can see the constructor and destructor of our DemoAnalyzer class:
// constructors and destructor
//
DemoAnalyzer::DemoAnalyzer(const edm::ParameterSet& iConfig)

{
   //now do what ever initialization is needed

}


DemoAnalyzer::~DemoAnalyzer()
{

   // do anything here that needs to be done at desctruction time
   // (e.g. close files, deallocate resources etc.)

}
Note that a ParameterSet object is passed to the constructor. This is then the
place where we will read any configuration we might end up implementing through
our Demo/DemoAnalyzer/demoanalyzer_cfg.py python configuration file.
The heart of the source file is the analyze method:
// ------------ method called for each event  ------------
void
DemoAnalyzer::analyze(const edm::Event& iEvent, const edm::EventSetup& iSetup)
{
   using namespace edm;



#ifdef THIS_IS_AN_EVENT_EXAMPLE
   Handle<ExampleData> pIn;
   iEvent.getByLabel("example",pIn);
#endif

#ifdef THIS_IS_AN_EVENTSETUP_EXAMPLE
   ESHandle<SetupData> pSetup;
   iSetup.get<SetupRecord>().get(pSetup);
#endif
}
Anything that goes inside this routine will loop over all available events. The
CMSSW Framework will take care of that, so you do not really have to write a
for loop to go over all events. Note that an edm::Event object and a edm::
EventSetup object are passed by default. While from the Event we can extract
information like physics objects, from the EventSetup we can get information
like trigger prescales.
     ***** Get the muons energy *****
     Now let’s add a few lines in the analyzer so we can retrieve the
     energy of all the muons in each event. We will print out this
     information as an example. Again, after checking out this_guide, the
     analyze method becomes:
     // ------------ method called for each event  ------------
     void DemoAnalyzer::analyze(const edm::Event& iEvent, const edm::
     EventSetup& iSetup)
     {
      using namespace edm;

      //clean the container
      muon_e.clear();

      //define the handler and get by label
      Handle<reco::MuonCollection> mymuons;
      iEvent.getByLabel("muons", mymuons);

      //if collection is valid, loop over muons in event
      if(mymuons.isValid()){
         for (reco::MuonCollection::const_iterator itmuon=mymuons->begin
     (); itmuon!=mymuons->end(); ++itmuon){
             muon_e.push_back(itmuon->energy());
         }
      }

      //print the vector
      for(unsigned int i=0; i < muon_e.size(); i++){
         std::cout <<"Muon # "<<i<<" with E = "<<muon_e.at(i)<<"
     GeV."<<std::endl;
      }

     #ifdef THIS_IS_AN_EVENT_EXAMPLE
       Handle<ExampleData> pIn;
       iEvent.getByLabel("example",pIn);
     #endif

     #ifdef THIS_IS_AN_EVENTSETUP_EXAMPLE
       ESHandle<SetupData> pSetup;
       iSetup.get<SetupRecord>().get(pSetup);
     #endif
     }
The other methods are designed to execute instructions according to their own
name description.
// ------------ method called once each job just before starting event loop  --
----------
void
DemoAnalyzer::beginJob()
{
}

// ------------ method called once each job just after ending the event loop  -
-----------
void
DemoAnalyzer::endJob()
{
}

// ------------ method called when starting to processes a run  ------------
void
DemoAnalyzer::beginRun(edm::Run const&, edm::EventSetup const&)
{
}

// ------------ method called when ending the processing of a run  ------------
void
DemoAnalyzer::endRun(edm::Run const&, edm::EventSetup const&)
{
}

// ------------ method called when starting to processes a luminosity block  --
----------
void
DemoAnalyzer::beginLuminosityBlock(edm::LuminosityBlock const&, edm::EventSetup
const&)
{
}

// ------------ method called when ending the processing of a luminosity block
------------
void
DemoAnalyzer::endLuminosityBlock(edm::LuminosityBlock const&, edm::EventSetup
const&)
{
}

For instance, any instructions placed inside the beginRun routine will be
executed every time the Framework sees a new Run (a Run is determined by the
start and stop of the acquisition of the CMS detector). One may use the
beginJob and endJob routines to, for example, book histograms or write output
files.
Let’s compile (heads-up: it will fail; see below)
scram b
     ***** Work assignment *****
     The compilation will invariably fail. This is because the Muon
     classes we added introduced some dependencies that need to be taken
     care of in the BuildFile.xml. We will deal with this in a moment.
     Now, however, it is a good time to submit your assignment for this
     lesson. Please copy the compilation error message you got and paste
     it to the corresponding section in our assignment_form; remember you
     must sign in and click on the submit button in order to save your
     work. You can go back to edit the form at any time.
So let’s modify the Demo/DemoAnalyzer/BuildFile.xml to include DataFormats/
MuonReco dependencies. It should look like:
<use name="FWCore/Framework"/>
<use name="FWCore/PluginManager"/>
<use name="DataFormats/MuonReco"/>
<use name="FWCore/ParameterSet"/>
<flags EDM_PLUGIN="1"/>
<export>
   <lib name="1"/>
</export>
Now, if you compile again, it should work. Then, we can run with the cmsRun
executable:
cmsRun Demo/DemoAnalyzer/demoanalyzer_cfg.py > mylog.log 2>&1 &
Let’s check the log file:
cat mylog.log

     Questions
         * What are the key elements of a CMSSW configuration file?
         * What kind of elements can I control at the configuration level?
     Objectives
         * Learn the basic structure of the Python implementation of a
           CMSSW configuration file.
         * Learn how to modify a config file in order to change parameters
           and/or run additional code.
***** CMSSW configuration Framework *****
The CMS software framework uses a “software bus” model. A single executable,
cmsRun, is used, and the modules are loaded at runtime. A configuration file,
fully written in Python, defines which modules are loaded, in which order they
are run, and with which configurable parameters they are run. Note that this is
not an interactive system. The entire configuration is defined once, at the
beginning of the job, and cannot be changed during running. This is the file
that you “feed” cmRun when it is executed.
***** Playing with the demoanalyzer_cfg.py file *****
In the case of our DemoAnalyzer we have been working with, its configuration
file is the demoanalyzer_cfg.py, which resides in the Demo/DemoAnalyzer/
directory of your CMSSW Demo package. Note that it does not reside in the Demo/
DemoAnalyzer/python directory (which is usually the case for python
configuration files). This does not really matter though. There is a specific
situation where this is important, and we will look at it later.
Meanwhile, if we explore what is in the Demo/DemoAnalyzer/python directory:
ls Demo/DemoAnalyzer/python
we will get:
__init__.py  __init__.pyc  demoanalyzer_cfi.py  demoanalyzer_cfi.pyc
You will note that there is a demoanalyzer_cfi.py in there. We will not pay
attention to this file now, but it instructive to point out that the _cfg and
_cfi descriptors are meaningful. While the former one defines a top level
configuration, the latter works more like a module initialization file. There
are also _cff files which bear pieces of configuration and so they are dubbed
config fragments. You can read a bit more about it in this_subsection of the
Workbook.
Ok, so the file we will play around with is just the Demo/DemoAnalyzer/
demoanalyzer_cfg.py. Let’s take a look with the nano editor:
nano Demo/DemoAnalyzer/demoanalyzer_cfg.py
The first instructions that you will find in all the top level CMSSW config
files are the lines
import FWCore.ParameterSet.Config as cms

process = cms.Process("Demo")
The first line imports our CMS-specific Python classes and functions, and the
second one creates a process object. This refers to a CMSSW process (the one we
will be configuring, of course). Essentially, the main idea is that we will be
feeding our process all the tasks that we need done by the CMSSW software or
its plugins. The process needs always a name. It could be any short word, but
it is usually chosen so it is meaningful. For instance, if the main task would
be to process the high level trigger information, an adequate name will be
“HLT”; if the process is actually the full reconstruction of the data, then it
is most likely assigned the name “RECO”. For our demo, we will leave our
creativity aside and just call it “Demo” (you can, of course, change it to your
linking).
Then, you will notice a line that loads something:
process.load("FWCore.MessageService.MessageLogger_cfi")
Actually, because of the _cfi tag, we know it is presumably a piece of Python
code that initializes some module. Indeed, it is the MessageLogger service. As
the name describes, it controls how the message logging is handled during the
job execution. The string "FWCore.MessageService.MessageLogger_cfi" tells you
exactly where to look for it on Github if you needed it. Note the structure
matches the repository’s, except that the python directory name is always
omitted when loading modules this way (this is why it is often important to put
config files in the python directory).
There is a whole Workbook_section regarding this module, but let’s just look at
a simple example.
     ***** Changing the logging frequency in our CMSSW job *****
     Suppose you want the Framework to report every 5 events instead of
     each event. Then one can simply add this line
     process.MessageLogger.cerr.FwkReport.reportEvery = 5
     right below the load line:
     process.load("FWCore.MessageService.MessageLogger_cfi")
     process.MessageLogger.cerr.FwkReport.reportEvery = 5
Note that all we are doing is loading the MessageLogger module and changing
just one parameter, the one in this_line, instead of going with the default
value, which is one.
For the next line
process.maxEvents = cms.untracked.PSet( input = cms.untracked.int32(10) )
it is easy to guess that it controls the number of events that are going to be
processed in our CMSSW job. It is worth noting that maxEvents is a untracked
variable within the Framework. In general, the system keeps track of what
parameters are used to create each data item in the Event and saves this
information in the output files. This can be used later to help understand how
the data was made. However, sometimes a parameter will have no effect on the
final objects created. Such parameters are declared untracked. More information
can be found in the Workbook.
Let’s change the number of events to 100:
process.maxEvents = cms.untracked.PSet( input = cms.untracked.int32(100) )
Next, there is the first module (also an object by itself) we are attaching to
our process object:
process.source = cms.Source("PoolSource",
    # replace 'myfile.root' with the source file you want to use
    fileNames = cms.untracked.vstring(
    #    'file:myfile.root'
        'root://eospublic.cern.ch//eos/opendata/cms/Run2012B/DoubleMuParked/
AOD/22Jan2013-v1/10000/1EC938EF-ABEC-E211-94E0-90E6BA442F24.root'
    )
)
Inside the process object there must be exactly one object assigned that has
Python type Source and is used for data input. There may be zero or more
objects for each of many other Python types. In the official production
configurations there can be hundreds or even thousands of objects attached to
the process. Your job is configured by your choice of objects to construct and
attach to the process, and by the configuration of each object. (This may be
done via import_statements or calls to the load function, instead of or in
addition to object construction.) Some of the Python types that may be used to
create these objects are listed in the Workbook.
     ***** Explore the PoolSource C++ *****
     Generally, all modules in our python configuration are associated
     with its corresponding C++ code. By searching the CMSSW_Github
     repository, will you be able to point exactly to the line of C++ code
     where the fileNames parameter is read?
          ***** solution *****
          You will find that the label first appearing in a Python
          CMSSW module is actually the name of the C++ code. So, we
          would expect that there be a class PoolSource.h (and
          perhaps its implementation as PoolSource.C) associated with
          the “PoolSource” label. Let’s then go to the Github_CMSSW
          repository and simply search for PoolSource.C using the
          search field of that page. Immediately, in the search
          results, we notice there is a IOPool/Input/src/
          PoolSource.cc file that we can browse. After looking for
          the variable fileNames, we find that this parameter is read
          in this_line. Note that it is in the constructor of the
          object where the ParameterSet objects are read.
Note also that the fileNames variable is a vstring, i.e., a vector of strings
in the C++ sense. In Python, it is a list, so you can very well input a comma
separated list of files. There is a drawback, though. In general, our open
datasets will contain more than 255 files, which is the limit for the number of
arguments a Python function can take, so very long vstrings cannot be created
in one step. There are various_alternatives to circumvent this problem. To run
over massive amounts of ROOT files, one will usually use the FileUtils module
to load index files instead of individual ROOT files.
***** Configure our DemoAnalyzer *****
The second to last line in our configuration
process.demo = cms.EDAnalyzer('DemoAnalyzer'
)
has to do with our recently created DemoAnalyzer. This module is now just a
declaration of existance because it is empty. Let’s put it to work:
     ***** Making our EDAnalyzer configurable *****
     Let’s pretend that for some reason you will need to run your job
     either for extracting the energy of RECO muons from beam collisions
     or from cosmic rays. Note that CMS has information from both. If you
     go back to the_guide we used earlier to help us with the muon
     information extraction, you will notice that there is the possibility
     to use an InputTag that is muonsFromCosmics instead of just muons.
     Your job is to make this configurable in our demoanalyzer_cfg.py so
     we don’t have to re-compile every time we want to make the switch.
          ***** Solution *****
          Since we are going to make our DemoAnalyzer configurable,
          the first thing we need to do is to modify the C++ source
          of our analyzer in order to accommodate configurability.
          Let’s modify then the Demo/DemoAnalyzer/src/DemoAnalyzer.cc
          file. Again, following the logic in the Physics_Ojects
          guide and using an editor, we should add the declaration
          for a muon InputTag. We could include this declaration
          right below the declaration of our member functions:
          virtual void endLuminosityBlock(edm::LuminosityBlock
          const&, edm::EventSetup const&);

          //declare the input tag for MuonCollection
          edm::InputTag muonInput;

          // ----------member data ---------------------------
          std::vector<float> muon_e;
          Then we will have to read this InputTag from the
          configuration. As it was noted above, this is done in the
          constructor. It will become:
          //constructors and destructor
          //
          DemoAnalyzer::DemoAnalyzer(const edm::ParameterSet&
          iConfig)

          {
            //now do what ever initialization is needed
            muonInput = iConfig.getParameter<edm::InputTag>
          ("InputCollection");
          }
          Here we will be reading the InputCollection variable from
          configuration (which is of type edm::InputTag, which is
          essentially_a_string) and will store it in the muonInput
          container.
          Next, we will modify the analyze function replacing this
          line
          iEvent.getByLabel("muons", mymuons);,
          where the InputTag is hard-coded as “muons”, with
          iEvent.getByLabel(muonInput, mymuons);,
          where we use the configurable muonInput variable.
          The section of interest in the analyze function will then
          look like:
          void DemoAnalyzer::analyze(const edm::Event& iEvent, const
          edm::EventSetup& iSetup){
            using namespace edm;
            //clean the container
            muon_e.clear();

           //define the handler and get by label
           Handle<reco::MuonCollection> mymuons;
           iEvent.getByLabel(muonInput, mymuons);

           //if collection is valid, loop over muons in event
           if(mymuons.isValid()){
             for (reco::MuonCollection::const_iterator
          itmuon=mymuons->begin(); itmuon!=mymuons->end(); ++itmuon){
                 muon_e.push_back(itmuon->energy());
              }
          }
          //print the vector
           . . .
          Finally, let’s change the Demo/DemoAnalyzer/
          demoanalyzer_cfg.py by replacing our empty module
          statement:
          process.demo = cms.EDAnalyzer('DemoAnalyzer')
          with
          process.demo = cms.EDAnalyzer('DemoAnalyzer',
                 InputCollection = cms.InputTag("muons")
          )
          In this way, we are now able to enter “muons” or
          “muonsFromCosmics”, depending on our needs.
Now, before re-compiling our code, let’s check that our python configuration is
ok. We can validate the syntax of your configuration using python:
python Demo/DemoAnalyzer/demoanalyzer_cfg.py
If there are no errors, you are good to go.
Now let’s compile the code; again, with scram:
scram b
If everything goes well, you should see something like:

Finally, let’s run the CMSSW job:

If you check the development of the job with
tail -f mylog.log
Eventually, as the job progresses, you will see something like:

***** Running some already-available CMSSW code *****
The last line in our Demo/DemoAnalyzer/demoanalyzer_cfg.py is
process.p = cms.Path(process.demo)
The “software bus” model that was mentioned in the introduction of this episode
can be made evident in this line. CMSSW executes its code using Paths (which in
turn could be arranged in Schedules). Each Path can execute a series of modules
(or Sequences of modules). In our example we have just one Path named p that
executes the demo process, which corresponds to our DemoAnalyzer.
In general, however, we could add more modules. For instance, the Path line
could look like
process.mypath = cms.Path (process.m1+process.m2+process.s1+process.m3)
, where m1, m2, m3 could be CMSSW modules (individual EDAnalyzers, EDFilters,
EDProducers, etc.) and s1 could be a modules_Sequence.
     ***** Adding a Trigger Filter *****
     In CMSSW, there are other types of code one can execute. Some of
     these are known as EDFilters. As the name implies, they can be used
     to filter events. For instance, one could use the HLTHighLevel filter
     class to only run over events that have passed a certain kind of
     trigger.
     We can get a hint of its usage by scooping around the corresponding
     python directory of that package. We immediately notice the
     hltHighLevel_cfi.py module, so let’s load it with the line
     process.load("HLTrigger.HLTfilters.hltHighLevel_cfi")
     Let’s configure the HLTPaths parameter in that module so it will only
     pass events that fired any trigger bit with the pattern HLT_Mu15*:
     process.hltHighLevel.HLTPaths = cms.vstring('HLT_Mu15*')
     Now, let’s add the module to our running Path:
     process.p = cms.Path(process.hltHighLevel+process.demo)
          ***** The full config file *****
          Do not forget to switch back to “muons” for the InputTag.
          The full config file will then look like:
          import FWCore.ParameterSet.Config as cms

          process = cms.Process("Demo")

          process.load("FWCore.MessageService.MessageLogger_cfi")
          process.MessageLogger.cerr.FwkReport.reportEvery = 5

          process.maxEvents = cms.untracked.PSet( input =
          cms.untracked.int32(100) )

          process.source = cms.Source("PoolSource",
             # replace 'myfile.root' with the source file you want to
          use
             fileNames = cms.untracked.vstring(
             #    'file:myfile.root'
                 'root://eospublic.cern.ch//eos/opendata/cms/
          Run2012B/DoubleMuParked/AOD/22Jan2013-v1/10000/1EC938EF-
          ABEC-E211-94E0-90E6BA442F24.root'
             )
          )

          process.demo = cms.EDAnalyzer('DemoAnalyzer',
                 InputCollection = cms.InputTag("muons")
          )

          process.load("HLTrigger.HLTfilters.hltHighLevel_cfi")
          process.hltHighLevel.HLTPaths = cms.vstring('HLT_Mu7*')

          process.p = cms.Path(process.hltHighLevel+process.demo)
     Without even having to compile again, the execution of the trigger
     path will stop if the hltHighLevel filter module throws a False
     result. The output becomes

     clearly prevents the execution of our EDAnalyzer.
Congratulations!!, you have made it to the end the lesson.
     ***** Key Points *****
         * The Python implementation of the configuration of CMSSW is
           fundamentally modular.
         * The CMSSW configuration allows for the usage of already
           available code and/or make changes to yours without having to
           recompile.
